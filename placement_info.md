# Placement Information

## The role
After the bootcamp, I will be working full-time at Elsevier (London) as a software engineer.
Prior to this bootcamp, I knew of Elsevier as a publisher of scientific journals and papers. I now appreciate that Elsevier are the organisation behind software products such as Mendeley, and more widely are an information analytics company specialising in science and healthcare. 
As part of Elsevier, I am working as part of the Entellect team. Entellect is a life sciences data integration platform, enabling insights to be derived from Elsevier's siloed data assets, and possibly external ones too.
I wanted to retrain as a software engineer because I wanted to embark on an impactful and rewarding career with greater scope for impact, while still being able to utilise my training as a research scientist.
