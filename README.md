# Lucinda Curnow - Makers Bootcamp Retro Diary

This retro diary serves as a record of evidence to document my progress through the Makers Bootcamp, with the aim of gaining proficiency as a software engineer.

The bootcamp is 12 weeks, divided into modules with their own learning outcomes. Evidence for their accomplishment are provided through links to relevant github repositories.
