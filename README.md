# Lucinda Curnow - Makers Bootcamp Retro Diary

This retro diary serves as a record of evidence to document my progress through the Makers Bootcamp, with the aim of gaining proficiency as a software engineer.

The bootcamp is 12 weeks in duration, divided into modules with their own learning outcomes. Evidence for their accomplishment are provided through links to relevant github repositories. The retro diary will then be continued on placement.

## Weeks 1 & 2: Basic Programming
> Learning outcomes:
> - Navigate a unix command line
> - Version control projects

Evidence: See Week_1_and_2

## Weeks 3 & 4: TDD & OOD
